        <p>The <code><mark>< a ></mark></code> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.</p>
        <p>Content within each <code><mark>< a ></mark></code> should indicate the link's destination. If the href attribute is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the <code><mark>< a ></mark></code> element will activate it.</p>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

    <section id="Header" class="main-section">
        <header>Header</header>
        <p>The <code><mark>< header ></mark></code> HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.</p>
        <p>The <code><mark>< header ></mark></code> element has an identical meaning to the site-wide banner landmark role, unless nested within sectioning content. Then, the <code><mark>< header ></mark></code> element is not a landmark.</p>

    <section id="Form" class="main-section">
        <header>Form</header>
        <p>The <code><mark>< form ></mark></code> HTML element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.</p>
        <p>It is possible to use the :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes to style a <code><mark>< form ></mark></code> element based on whether the elements inside the form are valid.</p>

    <section id="Span" class="main-section">
        <header>Span</header>
        <p>The <code><mark>< span ></mark></code> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <code><mark>< span ></mark></code> is very much like a <code><mark>< div ></mark></code> element, but <code><mark>< div ></mark></code> is a block-level element whereas a <code><mark>< span ></mark></code> is an inline-level element.</p>
